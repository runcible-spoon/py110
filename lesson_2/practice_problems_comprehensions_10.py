'''A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a type of identifier often 
used to uniquely identify items, even when some of those items were 
created on a different server or by a different application. That is, 
without any synchronization, two or more computer systems can create new
 items and label them with a UUID with no significant risk of stepping 
on each other's toes. It accomplishes this feat through massive 
randomization. The number of possible UUID values is approximately 3.4 X
 10E38, which is a huge number. The chance of a conflict, a "collision",
 is vanishingly small with such a large number of possible values.

Each UUID consists of 32 hexadecimal characters (the digits `0`-`9` and the letters `a`-`f`) 
represented as a string. The value is typically broken into 5 sections in an 8-4-4-4-12 pattern, 
e.g., `'f65c57f6-a6aa-17a8-faa1-a67f2dc9fa91'`.

Note that our description of UUIDs is a simplified description of how
 UUIDs are formed. There are several UUID versions, each with some 
non-random characteristics in some of the bits. These different versions
 can play a part in certain applications.

Write a function that takes no arguments and returns a string that contains a UUID.'''

import random



hexchar = '0123456789abcdef'

def uuid():
    eight = ''.join(random.choice(hexchar) for _ in range(8))
    four1 = ''.join(random.choice(hexchar) for _ in range(4))
    four2 = ''.join(random.choice(hexchar) for _ in range (4))
    four3 = ''.join(random.choice(hexchar) for _ in range(4))
    twelve = ''.join(random.choice(hexchar) for _ in range(12))

    lst = [eight, four1, four2, four3, twelve] 

    return'-'.join(lst)
